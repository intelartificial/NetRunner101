# NetRunner101
A series of programming courses of 15 minutes covering all major aspects of object oriented programming. All example will be done in .net 5 but could be easily translated to older .net framework, .net core, or java.

A few courses will be longer either because of the subject taking longer to teach or for better interaction between the teacher and participant.
